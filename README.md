<!-- Scope:
Just frontend - no backend for now. If it seems worthwhile, I may add one after completing this initial phase of the project. -->

<!-- Wireframe/Sketch:
Sketch out a very basic layout for the timer and the interface necessary for interacting with it. -->

Comoponent Planning:
Break the sketch down into components. Figure out where the containers will be, and which comoponents maintain state. What is going to make sound and how will the sound making be handled?

Frontend Build:
Build out the components with basic html/javascript before styling. Pick out fonts, colours, style elements and so on. Use a mobile first approach.

1 - finish building settings component including auto run feature and ability to customize study/break durations

1.2 - figure out popup window style for settings

2 - figure out the best way to add audio

3 - Figure out how to get browser notifications and display remaining time in the tab
